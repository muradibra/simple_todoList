# React + Vite

This is a simple todo list that is written using React. User can add new todos, check and uncheck them as they complete the todo item and delete any completed todos. The data persisting is achieved with local storage.
Here is a live demo to view the project on your machine: https://simpletodolist-react.vercel.app/
